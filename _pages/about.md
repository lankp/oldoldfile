- Postdoctoral research for Department of Mathematics at [Universit√° degli di Milano](https://www.unimi.it/en) under the supervision of [Amnon Neeman](https://www.unimi.it/en/ugov/person/amnon-neeman).
- During April 2024, I was a research associate at the [Simons-Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute](https://www.slmath.org/programs/356). Prior to this, I was a PhD student at the University of South Carolina under the supervision of [Matthew Ballard](https://www.matthewrobertballard.com), as well as an M.Sc. student at the University of New Mexico under the supervision of [Alexandru Buium](http://www.math.unm.edu/~buium). 
- Much of my work focuses on the application of derived categories to problems in both algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. 
- A copy of my CV may be found [here](lankp.github.io/files/Lank-CV.pdf).
